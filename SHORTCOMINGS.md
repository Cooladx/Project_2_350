# Shortcomings of Apache CouchDB

1. **Performance**: CouchDB can be slower compared to other NoSQL databases, especially when handling large volumes of data or complex queries.

2. **Limited Query Capabilities**: CouchDB's querying capabilities are not as advanced as some other databases. It relies heavily on MapReduce, which can be less intuitive and more cumbersome for complex queries.

3. **Replication Conflicts**: While CouchDB's replication is a strong feature, it can lead to conflicts that need to be resolved manually, which can be time-consuming and complex.

4. **Tooling and Ecosystem**: The ecosystem and tooling around CouchDB are not as mature or extensive as those for other databases like MongoDB or PostgreSQL.

5. **Documentation and Community Support**: Although improving, the documentation and community support for CouchDB are not as robust as for some other databases, which can make troubleshooting and learning more difficult.

6. **Scalability**: CouchDB's scalability can be limited compared to other NoSQL databases, particularly when it comes to horizontal scaling.

7. **ACID Transactions**: CouchDB does not support multi-document ACID transactions, which can be a limitation for applications requiring strong consistency guarantees.

8. **Indexing**: Indexing in CouchDB can be less flexible and slower compared to other databases, which can impact performance for certain types of queries.
